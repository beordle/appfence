Getting start
=============

= Prerequistie
The project is using Android NDK toolchain (compilers, scripts, debuggers). We need `Android SDK` and `Android NDK`.

= Eclipse setup
* We need some environment variables in Eclipse for the NDK path. Here are the pics.
* First setup the Android NDK path:
![][ndk_path]
* Second setup the environment variables
![][eclipse_env]
